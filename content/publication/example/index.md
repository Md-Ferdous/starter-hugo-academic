abstract: With numerous countermeasures, the number of deaths in the
  construction industry is still higher compared to other industries. Personal
  Protective Equipment (PPE) is constantly being improved to avoid these
  accidents, although workers intentionally or unintentionally forget to use
  such safety measures. It is challenging to manually run a safety check as the
  number of co-workers on a site can be large; however, it is a prime duty of
  the authority to provide maximum protection to the workers on the working
  site. From these motivations, we have created a computer vision (CV) based
  automatic PPE detection system that detects various types of PPE. This study
  also created a novel dataset named CHVG (four colored hardhats, vest, safety
  glass) containing eight different classes, including four colored hardhats,
  vest, safety glass, person body, and person head. The dataset contains 1,699
  images and corresponding annotations of these eight classes. For the detection
  algorithm, this study has used the You Only Look Once (YOLO) familyâ€™s
  anchor-free architecture, YOLOX, which yields better performance than the
  other object detection models within a satisfactory time interval. Moreover,
  this study found that the YOLOX-m model yields the highest mean average
  precision (mAP) than the other three versions of the YOLOX.
